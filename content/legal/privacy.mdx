I respect your privacy. This policy applies to all my apps and this website.

## What I Don't Collect

I don't collect, store, or track any personal information for marketing, analytics, or advertising purposes. There are no third-party tracking services, advertising networks, or data brokers involved.

## How Your Data is Stored

My apps use Apple's CloudKit to store your dataâ€”such as your meal plans, content you create, or app preferences. This data is stored in your personal iCloud account and syncs across your devices. I cannot access, view, or use your data stored in CloudKit. Apple manages this data according to their privacy policy.

## What I Can See

I have no access to your personal data. CloudKit keeps your information private and tied to your Apple ID.

## Cookies

This website only uses essential cookies required for the site to function. No tracking or advertising cookies are used.

## Your Control

Your data is stored in your iCloud account. You can delete the app or manage your iCloud storage through your device settings to remove all data at any time.
